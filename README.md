# tablature

Converts a Markdown document to a specification and documents a specification as markdown. Markdown can automatically be rendered as a web page in GitHub or other sites. This is an easy way to publish rules of engagement. Roundtrip is supported, allowing a user to update a specification iteratively with an ordinary text editor.

For a brief introduction to markdown, see [Markdown Notation](https://github.com/FIXTradingCommunity/tablature/wiki/Markdown-Notation).

## FIX Orchestra
