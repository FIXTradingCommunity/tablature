Margin excess/deficit will provide information about the surplus or shortfall compared to the previous trading day or a more recent margin calculation. An inquiry for net position information will trigger one or more PositionReport messages instead of one or more MarginRequirementReport messages./P/If the inquiry is made at the detail level, an Instrument block must be provided with the desired level of detail. If the inquiry is made at the summary level, the Instrument block is not provided, implying a summary request is being made. For example, if the inquiring firm specifies the Security Type of “FUT” in the Instrument block, then a detail report will be generated containing the margin requirements for all futures positions for the inquiring account. Similarly, if the inquiry is made at the summary level, the report will contain the total margin requirement aggregated to the margin account level.                                 |
